<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


Proposal and Task Breakdown
Your Final Project proposal is due. You should submit a link to a GitHub project that will house your submission. The project README should contain your project proposal. Your proposal should include:

### Scenario
1. A description of the scenario your project is operating in.
> This project serves to provide the back-end and database components for a vendor credentialing (VC) project. The authentication method used in the VC project are zero-knowledge proofs. Due to this, API calls are needed between a UI/Blockchain and the back-end and database.

### Problem
2. A description of what problem your project seeks to solve.
> Third-party data leaks is a common occurrence and rising issue in healthcare.  A way to reduce the issue is to minimize the number of instances personal information is uploaded to databases. All hospital vendors require service workers to upkeep their vendor credentials throughout the year in order to maintain access to any hospital. A pain point in the industry is having a service worker upload the same personal information to different vendor credentialing companies. The process creates additional administrative costs and increases attack vectors that leads to personal data leaks. By applying the principals of a zero-knowledge protocol, zero information from a personal record will be shared to vendor credential companies but still allow for credentials to become verified.

### Components
3. A description of what the technical components of your project will be, including: the routes, the data models, any external data sources you'll use, etc.
<br>
> Components:
<br>
> Creating user access for employees with assigned roles (i.e. admin, level#)
<br>
> Routes
<br>
> Data models
<br>
