<!-- FINAL UPDATE -->

## Final Project Update

> (06/17/23)

### Self-Evaluation

#### Approach

> I was introduced to test-driven development in the last frontend course but I barely achieved as much coverage as I had in this project which is something I'm very proud to have completed. Being able to work through weekly assignments that prioritized learning how to code with unit tests was valuable to me. In prior roles outside of software development, I'm always someone who puts more thought into a plan before tackling problems and unit tests allows this to happen. Even with the use of mermaid diagrams which was something I recently learned about to help visually plan the flow of an application, by writing unit tests, it allowed me stay organized throughout the project as I worked on various sections of my code. Unit tests also ensured areas of my code that were dependent on an updated section were always put into my attention when there were breaking changes.

#### Results

> Overall I'm satisfied with what I was able to accomplish in this project from completing over 90% test coverage, completing all CRUD requirements, applying authentication, and finding an area to apply some advance mongoDB methods such as an aggregation with multiple pipeline stages. I'm glad to have deployed the backend and setup mongo atlas as we had learned in class. Additionally I'm also glad to have created a sample frontend to tie this whole program together into this project.

- Deployed API/Backend: https://uw-jscript330b-final-project-production.up.railway.app

#### Learned

> This final project went very well with minimal issues completing the requirements. In comparison to my frontend project from the last course which I did have a well thought design plan, however the impact from having a significantly lesser amount of unit tests made the experience felt disorganized. This has been a great experience to see the value of prioritizing a test driven development approach earlier and throughout a project. My knowledge of creating unit tests for the backend has greatly improved when compared to only fixing code based on prebuilt tests during the weekly class assignments. I have a greater understanding of Express, Node.js, and MongoDB after successfully creating this project. Also coming into the course I had my mind on learning more about CORS as it was an issue I did not resolve in my last frontend project. With the knowledge I now have with creating APIs, I was able to play with CORS settings and learn about the errors while adding a sample frontend. Lastly, I learned about a new frontend build tool called Vite after finding out that the Create React App tool which was highly utilized in the last course was no longer being maintained. In summary, I have learned a great amount of knowledge during this backend course and the overall full-stack program to continue building fun applications.

#### Improvements

- Find ways to refactor code.
- Work with a large dataset.
- Integrate actual external components.
- Update the frontend to apply all routes.
- Obtain 100% coverage.

### Project Setup

#### API Backend

- Server Deployed: https://uw-jscript330b-final-project-production.up.railway.app
- For local setup, in root project directory:

  `cd backend && npm install`

  `npm start`

- API will be accessible via http://localhost:3000/

#### Frontend Sample

- In root project directory:

  `cd frontend-vite && npm install`

  `npm run dev`

- App will be accessible via http://localhost:3001/
- Fetch routes will need to be updated if running backend locally

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

### Scenario

> This project serves to provide the back-end and database components for a Vendor Credentialing (VC) application for use in the Healthcare service industry. All vendors that perform work at a hospital or clinic are required to be fully compliant on any credentialing requirements. Most hospital network outsources this process to a third-party VC company. A hospital network will provide a list of requirements to the third-party VC company to manage the data collection and authorization of vendors to access a facility (i.e. data can include identification, background screening, completed training materials, and medical records).

### Problem

> Third-party data leaks are a common occurrence and one that continues to rise in healthcare <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/news/252521771/Healthcare-breaches-on-the-rise" target="_blank">June 2022</a>. A way to reduce the issue is to minimize the number of instances personal information are uploaded to databases. A pain point in the industry is having to upload the same personal documents to multiple vendor credentialing companies when access to multiple hospitals are needed. The process creates additional administrative costs and increases attack vectors that leads to personal data leaks. By applying the principals of a zero-knowledge protocol, zero information from a personal record will be shared to vendor credential companies but still allow for credentials to become verified. Solving this problem in the vendor credentialing process could also lead to the adoption of zero-knowledge protocols deeper in the healthcare industry to improve the security of sharing and tracking electronic medical records.

### Components

<!-- 3. A description of what the technical components of your project will be, including: the routes, the data models, any external data sources you'll use, etc. -->

#### External Components:

- Two external components will be simulated in this project. An Electronic data verification system (a component to authenticate input data) and a Zero-knowledge component (produces the zk proof).

#### Routes:

- Login

  - A user will be required to login with an username/password to obtain a JWT token. This route will deny access if required inputs are not received in a request.

- Middleware

  - A request that holds a Bearer token will be validated before accessing subsequent functions. Token expiration will occur after 15 mins which a new token will be generated for any activity within the the last 5 mins of the 15 min window. (Timing will be simulated during demo)

- Create

  - An Admin will only have the access to create a new user with an assigned role. A new document will be created in the User collection DB. Invalid inputs will be rejected.
  - Only Vendor users will be able to upload an electronic version of a personal record. The record will be authenticated through a simulated Electronic data verification system before passed into the ZK component to generate a ZK proof. All necessary data required for the zk system to function is saved into the User_Data collection DB.
    - The uploading of an electronic personal record will be simulated through a simple data object in the request body.

- Read data

  - Admins will be able to retrieve data for any userId in the User collection. Admins will have a route to retrieve all userIds by a group ID. No access to the User_Data collection is permitted.
  - Admins will be able to search records relating to a user's name, email, phone and retrieve a limit of 5 documents based on input.
  - A vendor user will be able to view data matching to their userId from both the User and User_Data collections.
  - Verifiers will have access to read data matching it's userId from the User collection. Verifiers also have a route to perform a zero knowledge verification. This will require that the verifier has a role that allows for verifications of specific data on vendor users.

- Updating data

  - Admins will have access to update limited data fields to email, phone, and password.
  - Vendor and Verifier users will have access to update their own email, phone, and password data.
  - Vendor users will be able to upload an electronic version of a personal record to update an existing record. The record will be authenticated through a simulated Electronic data verification system before passed into the ZK component to generate a ZK proof. All necessary data required for the zk system to function is saved into the User_Data collection DB.
    - Similar to the create function, the uploading of an electronic personal record will be simulated through a simple data object in the request body.

- Deleting data
  - Admins are allowed to delete a user and all data in both User and User_Data collections by userId. Vendor and Verifier users will not have access to this feature.
  - Vendor user are able to delete a personal record by a personal record ID

#### Data models:

- User \* Fields include a User ID, Name, Email, Phone, Password, vendorGroupId, and verifierGroupId
  - Index will be used on the name, email, and phone fields.
- User_Data - Fields will include a User ID, array of personal data (Project example: personalRecord01, ..., personalRecordN), and a zkProof string
  - Aggregate and Lookup methods will be used to connect the User and User_Data collections and display requesting documents to a Vendor user.
- zkTransactions (TBD - This portion may not be included in project or a simple model will be use for demo) \* All zk related data
  - In any route that utilizes zk transactions, a transaction record will be saved to the User_zkTransactions collection containing data related to the zk changes. This will allow for a zk recursion feature if implemented in the project. A purpose of this feature could be utilized for audit scenarios requiring detailed external recreation of zk proofs. During any updates to a vendor user's User_Data, the old zk proof can be used as an input field to generate a new zk proof. This will allow for faster verifications at any point in time when evaluating a timeline of changes in the User personal data.
